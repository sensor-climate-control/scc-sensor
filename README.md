# scc-sensor
This is the sensor repository for the Oregon State University Sensor-Based In-Home Climate Control Capstone Project

- Requires a separate .ino file per sensor so that the data can be sent in organized topics. 

- Micro controller sends data to raspberry pi, pi now needs to do something usefull with it

- Maybe Automate sensor code creation
  - just need to change topic name per sensor (sensor1, sensor2, etc.)
